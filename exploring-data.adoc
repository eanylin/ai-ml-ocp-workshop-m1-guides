== Exploring Data

You will be using Jupyter notebooks from
https://opendatahub.io/[OpenDataHub^] to explore credit card fraud
https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud[data^], using tools such
as https://dvc.org/[dvc^] and https://pandas.pydata.org/[Pandas^].

== About OpenDataHub

Open Data Hub is a blueprint for building an AI as a service platform on
Red Hat’s Kubernetes-based OpenShift® Container Platform and Ceph Object
Storage. It inherits from upstream efforts such as Kafka/Strimzi and
Kubeflow, and is the foundation for Red Hat’s internal data science and
AI platform. Data scientists can create models using Jupyter notebooks,
and select from popular tools such as TensorFlow™, scikit-learn, Apache
Spark™ and more for developing models. Teams can spend more time solving
critical business needs and less on installing and maintaining
infrastructure with the Open Data Hub.

== About JupyterHub

JupyterHub fron ODH allows OpenShift users to access Jupyter notebooks.
It gives users access to computational environments and resources
without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks.

== About DVC

DVC keeps metafiles in Git to describe and version control your data
sets and models. DVC supports a variety of external storage types as a
remote cache for large files.

Data management is the core part of DVC for large files, datasets, ML
models versioning and efficient sharing. In this workshop, you will be
using DVC to retrieve the dataset from a S3 bucket provided by OCS4.

== Logging in

Begin by logging into {{JUPYTERHUB_URL}}[JupyterHub^].

Your user name will be `{{  USER_ID }}` and password is
`{{  OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`.
You may see a notification on authorizing access, select “Allow selected permissions” and proceed.

Upon logging in, start a new notebook by choosing
`s2i-minimal-notebook:3.6` image in the drop down box and then click on
`Spawn`. Leave the rest of the options as default.

[NOTE]
====
If the notebook page did not appear, try refreshing the page or
reach out to your instructor.

====

Once the notebook page is up and running, there is a notebook `"{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/notebooks/0 intro to juypyter.ipynb"` to help you get started on familiarizing with the Jupyter interface.

After you have acquainted yourself with how to edit and run Jupyter Notebooks, click on `"{{USER_MODEL_REPO_NAME}}/notebooks/1 data exploration.ipynb"` to load the notebook. Run the individual code blocks contained in this notebook and observe the output.

After running notebook “1 data exploration”, the output would be similar to the example below.
