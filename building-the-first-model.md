## Build Your First Model

In this module, you will begin to use Jupyter Notebook to build, train and test the model.

## Logging in
Begin by logging into [JupyterHub]({{JUPYTERHUB_URL}}). 

Your user name will be `{{  USER_ID }}` and password is `{{  OPENSHIFT_USER_PASSWORD }}`.

Upon logging in, start a new notebook by choosing `s2i-minimal-notebook:3.6` image in the drop down box and then click on `Spawn`. Leave the rest of the options as default.

> If the notebook page did not appear, try refreshing the page or reach out to your instructor. 

Once the notebook page is up and running, click on `notebooks/2 xxxx.ipynb` to load the notebook.
