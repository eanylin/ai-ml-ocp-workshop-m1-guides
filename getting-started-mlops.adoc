== Getting Started with MLOps

In the next few modules you will look at how AI/ML workload on OpenShift
(OCP) can be integrated with Red Hat Middleware portfolio, focusing on
MLOps, which enables data science and IT teams to collaborate and
increase the pace of model development and deployment.

This workshop is for data scientists and ML engineers who want to apply
DevOps Principles to MLOps.

== Automating The End-To-End Lifecycle Of Machine Learning Applications

In reality, that intelligent application isn’t just one small deployed
thing. It is an entire distributed system in and of itself with many
moving parts that are all tied together in various ways. A data
scientist’s model is just one small part of this large distributed
system, but we’re going to focus on it for this workshop

As shown in the following diagram, only a small fraction of a real-world
ML system is composed of the ML code. The required surrounding elements
are vast and complex.

== What Is MLOps

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps[Wikipedia^]:

____
MLOps (a compound of `machine learning` and `operations`) is a
practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and
operations professionals to help manage production ML (or deep learning)
lifecycle. Similar to the DevOps or DataOps approaches, MLOps looks to
increase automation and improve the quality of production ML while also
focusing on business and regulatory requirements.

== Differences Between DevOps And MLOps

Unlike DevOps, MLOps is much more experimental in nature. Data
scientists try different features, parameters and models. With all these
changes, they must manage their code base and datasets, to create
reproducible results.

Unlike application developments, MLOps needs to:

* Data/model versioning != code versioning: Model reuse has an entirely
different meaning compared to software reuse, as models need tuning
based on scenarios and data.
* Model monitoring. Models statistics needs to be monitored to ensure is
performing within limits, so that it can be retrained when necessary
(retraining needs to be on-demand)
* Testing. In addition to unit tests, models need to be validated for
model quality, such as accuracy, AUC, ROC, confusion matrix, precision,
recall, etc.

As such:

* Continuous integration (CI) for MLOps also involves validating the
data and the schema in addition to testing code.
* Continuous deployment(CD) validating the performance of models in
production – including the ability to deploy new models and rollback
changes from a model.
* Continuous testing (CT) to retrain and serve models. CT is unique to
ML systems that is for

=== Model Building

Once the data has been cleaned and is made available, we will start the
iterative approach for model building.

==== Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation and Experimentation

As the ML process is very experimental in nature and you may have
multiple experiments running in parallel, it is important to capture key
model metrics. This helps in the decision whether the model can be
promoted through the different stages, such as staging and finally to
production.

We will be using https://jupyter.org/hub[JupyterHub^] and
https://www.mlflow.org/[MLFlow^] to log the model and experiment results.

==== Reproducible Dataset

This allows the data scientists to reproduce the model results, but also
allows them to share the work with fellow data scientists or machine
learning engineers who need to deploy the model.

We will be using https://dvc.org/[dvc^] in this workshop.

=== Productize Model

Once a model has been chosen, we will begin to productize the model from
a notebook to source code. This allows better source revision control
compared to having a notebook in a Source Code Management (SCM).

We will be using
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F[Git^] to
version control the source code.

=== Testing

As part of the pipeline, the model will be validated and tested.

=== Model Deployment

Once the model has been built, the model will be packaged into a
container image and deployed onto OpenShift by the pipeline.

==== Model Serving

The model will be served using https://www.seldon.io/[Seldon^]. The
pipeline will build an image using Source-to-Image
(https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[S2I^]) and deploy the model
onto OpenShift.

=== Model Monitoring and Observability

Seldon models can expose prometheus endpoints which we will use to
monitor key model metrics using the Grafana dashboard.

=== Continuous Delivery

https://tekton.dev/[Tekton^] CI/CD pipeline will be used in the workshop
to automate the different stages, such as building, testing, deployment
and promotion of the model onto OpenShift.

Let’s get started!
